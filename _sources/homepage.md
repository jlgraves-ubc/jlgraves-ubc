# Welcome to my GitHub Homepage

This is a small repository to allow open access to some of my teaching and data curation resources.  I'm slowly migrating and adding files to this, so keep an eye out.

* You may also want to check out my [online workshops](https://github.com/jlgraves-ubc/workshops)
* Or you can check out my [faculty web-page](https://jonathanlgraves.arts.ubc.ca/)
