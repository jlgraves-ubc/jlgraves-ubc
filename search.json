I wouldn’t be enrolled in this class right now without Fangraphs, and I say that with absolute certainty. In terms of its function, it’s a one stop shop for all things Sabermetrics - from basic stats like Retrosheet, to hyper advanced ones, to articles, to projection models, to scouting, to community research. This website is the backbone of the analytically inclined baseball community. - JS"

Compared to FanGraphs, which is primarily calculated metrics from in-game results, all Statcast metrics have a level of rawness to them. Instead of ERA, you will find average exit velocity and launch angle. - JS"

It is directly linked to Statcast data, as well as FanGraphs, which makes it super easy. Also, to my understanding this (and a similar package for Python) are the only methods of retrieving raw play-by-play statcast data, which is necessary in creating advanced models - JS"
